            ID My Team is a system to implement custom events based on team members appearing in front of a camera.

            ID My Team is a completely new way to interact with your team. Whether it's for security, efficiency or just for entertainment, ID My Team would sit nicely by your front door.

            We use machine learning to implement off-site detection and classification of team members. This means that the system is constantly learning to produce unbeatable accuracy - a member comes in with a new pink mohawk? The system will adapt - even if you don't.

            The system includes a web panel for your team to manage and classify your team members as well as a load more features.

        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        <div class="col s12">
            Images are never stored on our server for more than a few milliseconds (unless your team would like to <a href="/permit-face-sorage">help our recognition models improve</a>).
        </div>
        <div class="col s12">
            Once an image has been uploaded, be it for training or recognition, the system converts it to 128 numbers used to identify the individual and the image is then deleted (unless you have opted to <a href="/permit-face-sorage">help out</a>). These 128 numbers work solely with the models on our server, and are completely arbitrary otherwise.
        </div>

        <div class="col s12">
            Images are never stored with any identifiable information alongside them. A unique identifier is generated that only the local system ran by your team can correlate to a team member.
