        By allowing us to store images of your teams face you will help our model improve its recognition accuracy. We will not store any identifiable information (name, etc...) as these are never passed to the server anyway. Instead we just store that this face belongs to a unique individual. Once the image has been stored for further training the model, it will be deleted forever.
